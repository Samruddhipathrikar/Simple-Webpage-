# Simple-Webpage-
This project is a basic static webpage created using HTML and CSS. It features a well-structured layout with a navigation bar, homepage section, and a contact form. The design is made responsive using CSS Flexbox and Grid, ensuring a smooth experience across different screen sizes. This project helped me practice webpage structuring.
